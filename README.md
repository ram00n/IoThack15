# Play! aka IoThack15
Our goal at the #IoThack15 is to play around with technology, get some insights and have fun. Learning by doing.

# 1) LoRaLei (done, PoC working)
Measuring the Limmat temperature and transmitting data over LoRa. The data is then forwarded via IFTTT to ThingSpeak (<https://thingspeak.com/channels/64458>).

# 2) Garbage Digger (work in progress)

# 3) Hello Beacon! (done, PoC working)
A first app using Interactor (<interactor.swisscom.ch>) and some iBeacons. Triggers a notification on the iPhone, as soon as one gets close to a beacon.

# 4) Wo ist Walter?
An offline indicator that shows the current location of a person, using beacons for localization.

# 5) Beaconized Shopping List (planned)
Create a shopping list on your phone (e.g. apples, bananas, water). As soon as you come close to a store that offers apples, you'll get a notification.
